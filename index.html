                Hi! I'm Bradley Hsu, currently an undergrad at 
                Washington University in St. Louis majoring in CS + Math. 
                <br> 
                I'm super passionate about tech and I love to make things.
                I have full stack skills, and  I'm especially interested in 
                machine learning.

                    WashU students didn't have a single place to find links 
                    to their class's group chats. As a solution, my roommate and 
                    I made a website for students to post and get links to their 
                    class's group chats. So far, it's been used by 300+ people, 
                    and more than 1/4 of my WashU class.

                    During COVID, my university's cafeterias distributed food in 
                    single-use containers. To decrease waste, they offered an 
                    Eco2Go program, allowing students to opt into using durable, 
                    reusable containers that would have to be returned after 
                    eating. Very few students were aware of Eco2Go, so the 
                    program was not widely used.

                    Therefore, while at Caltech's Hacktech 2021, my roommate and 
                    I made a tracker for our university's Eco2Go program to spread 
                    awareness of the program and decrease the use of unsustainable 
                    single-use plastics.

                    Backpropagation is the algorithm that machine learning 
                    algorithms use to "learn." When I was learning machine 
                    learning, I found it hard to understand backprop, so I 
                    looked for an interactive visualizer of the algorithm, but 
                    I couldn't find anything. Therefore, I decided to make one.
