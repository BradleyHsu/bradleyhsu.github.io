                Hi! I'm Bradley Hsu, currently an undergrad at Washington University 
                in St. Louis majoring in CS + Math. 
                <br> 
                I'm super passionate about tech and I love to make things.

                    WashU students didn't have a single place to find links 
                    to their class's group chats.
                    As a solution, my roommate and I made a website for students 
                    to post and get links to their class's group chats.
                    So far, it's been used by 300+ people, and more than
                    1/4 of my WashU class.

                Eco2Go Tracker (Winner at Hacktech 2021!)
            </summary>
                <p class = "paragraph"> 
                    During COVID, my university's cafeterias distributed food in 
                    single-use containers. 
                    To decrease waste, they offered an Eco2Go program, allowing 
                    students to opt into using durable, reusable containers that 
                    would have to be returned after eating. 
                    Very few students were aware of Eco2Go, so the program was 
                    not widely used.
                </p>
                <p class = "paragraph">
                    Therefore, while at Caltech's Hacktech 2021, my roommate and 
                    I made a tracker for our university's Eco2Go program to spread 
                    awareness of the program and decrease the use of unsustainable 
                    single-use plastics.

                Backpropagation Visualizer (the first of it's kind!)
            </summary>
                <p class = "paragraph">
                    Backpropagation is the algorithm that machine learning 
                    algorithms use to "learn." 
                    When I was learning machine learning, I found it hard to 
                    understand backprop, so I looked for an interactive visualizer 
                    of the algorithm, but I couldn't find anything.
                    Therefore, I decided to make one.
